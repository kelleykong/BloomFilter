BloomFilter
===========

Dictionary with Bloom Filter algorithm by C++

==============================================

It's a project I finished in Oct. 2010 when I'm a sophomore student in Nanjing University.
It is just a class project, by which Data Structure teacher hopes us to get a skill to learn a new algorithm 
related with our class by ourself and learn to implement it. 

Bloom Filter is an algorithm similar with HashTable.

I apply Bloom Filter to a dictionary application. When users want to find a word, the Bloom Filter will help to find
the word in the dictionary. There may be some errors but Bloom Filter really reduces the time consumption to loop up 
the dictionary from O(N) to O(1).
